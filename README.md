# Riggs' Helix Plugins
## Gnome Killer
A Plugin which let's people kill gnomes with guns and after death they create a high pitched scream.

## Dynamic Flashlight
A Plugin which disables the default flashlight and replaces it with a dynamic light version, it also creates pitched on/off sounds. Credits also go to scotnay for helping me do this.

## Firstperson
A Plugin which adds options for you to enable full body camera that can add to immersion for passive roleplay or even combat roleplay when you feel like it.

## Wakeup Messages
A Simple Plugin which on character load, displays a message depending on your character's health and will fade out with stinger music playing.
